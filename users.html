                    <p class="text-faded">Blast is a spontaneous event finder, which aims to tackle	the	problem	of wanting to do something in the immediate future but not having made any plans. Users can either use this app to find and join an event close them, or advertise an event that they want to host.</p>
					<p class="text-faded">While there are alternative services that attempt to enhance social lives, they cater to exclusive, rigid group structuring. Our app is unique because it supports spontaneity through showing all events happening and created within a 24 hour time span.</p>
					<p class="text-faded">We offer our users an opportunity to broaden their social lives and meet others in their community while doing a fun activity that doesn't require extensive planning or foresight.</p>

                <h2>Installation and Running</h2>
				<p class="text-faded text-left">
				This app is only available for download for Android. We are targeting KitKat with version 4.4 and API level 19. It was developed with the intent of being used on a phone, but will work on devices. We developed specifically for the Nexus 6 so we can only guarantee funtionality for other and older phones, but the format and layout is subject to change. Unfortunately we do not have the time or resources to develop for addition platforms.
				</p>
				<h3>Installing on a Device and Running</h3>
				<p class="text-faded text-left">
				*The app is not up on the Playstore yet. These are the directions for when it is.*
				Go to the Google Playstore on your device. This could be through the app or the internet. Search Blast and select the app with the icon of an elephant. Accept the app requirements and wait for it to install.
				</p>
				<p class="text-faded text-left">
				Once the app has downloaded and finished installing on your device, click on it and login in to use. See more details below in the section "Using the Blast".
				</p>
				<p class="text-faded text-left">
				Download the APK file and run on your device. Test users must use the account oliver_efugadr_queen@tfbnw.net with password blast123 to sign in.

				<h3>Installing on a Computer and Running</h3>
				<p class="text-faded text-left">
				To run Blast on a computer you will need:
					<ul class="text-faded text-left">
						<li>an emulator- we used and suggest Genymotion. Make an account and download the program.</li>
						<li>Android Studio</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				
				<p class="text-faded text-left">
					The previous dependency on an IP address for location services has been removed. However, users now need to have Google Apps installed on their device. For the Genymotion emulator, these are the instructions to install Google Apps:</br>
					Installing Google Apps on Genymotion
					<ol class="text-faded text-left">
						<li>Upgrade Genymotion and VirtualBox to the latest version</li>
						<li>Make sure your computer has `adb`</li>
						<li>Download two zip files: [ARM Translation Installer v1.1](http://filetrip.net/dl?4SUOrdcMRv) and [Google Apps for Android version 5.0](https://www.androidfilehost.com/?fid=95784891001614559) or later</li>
						<li>Install ARM Translation:
							<ul>
								<li>Open Genymotion emulator and drag/drop the Genymotion-ARM-Translation_v1.1.zip file over the emulator on the home screen</li>
								<li>A dialog will appear and show as file transfer in prgress</li>
								<li>Wait for another dialog to appear and click OK</li>
								<li>Wait for the third dialog that shows as the file has been successfully transfered</li>
								<li>Reboot the virtual device through command line, with `adb reboot`</li>
								<li>Be patient and wait around 10-20 minutes until it's done rebooting (you can tell it's done from the command line by prompting into a new line)</li>
								
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Install gapps:
							<ul>
								<li>Stay on the home screen on Genymotion. Drag and drop the gapps-lp-20141109-signed.zip file onto the screen</li>
								<li>Repeat the same substeps from step 4 regarding dialogs and rebooting</li>
								<li>Be even more patient! This time you will have to wait for 30-40 minutes</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Update all the Google Maps through Google Play Store:
							<ul>
								<li>After the virtual device is rebooted up, you will see a dialog saying that “Unfortunately, Google Play service has stopped.” Click OK and continue on</li>
								<li>If you don't see any dialog popping up saying that "Google Play Services has stopped," close your virtual machine and restart your genymotion device. Then you will see another dialog saying that you need to update your application</li>
								<li>Open your Google Play Store and update all your installed apps. Remember to update Google Play Services (Most important step!)</li>
							</ul>
						<li>You're done!</li>
					</ol>

                    <h3 class="system"> Understanding the System </h3>
                    <p class="text-faded">
                    Our goal is to make this app simple, yet provide lots of functionality. The user experience is centered around a single, main screen so all the tools are easily accessible. This helps reduce the number of different screens the user must click through to get to the information or action they want. To ensure a smooth interaction we provide as much data as we can immediately to the user. If all the information can't fit on the screen, we make it only one tap away. When the user must fill in data, we have an easy form laid out with clear markings of what needs to be completed. The software was designed to be like the process of looking for events and creating events on Facebook because this is a familiar experience for most people. If you are looking for an event it will be like Facebook's "upcoming events" list. Our list will have a background picture, time, place, description, and guest/attending list. If you are creating an event, it will be in a similar order of data input starting with a title, then time, place, picture, description, and our feature of ideal number of attendees. There are no modes for our app since we give users all the functionality on one screen. Our workflow is simple. From the main screen, look for events by scrolling and adding yourself to events, create an event by completing the form provided, check events you are hosting or modify them, and check events you are attending or remove yourself from the guest list.
