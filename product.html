					<p class="text-faded">We offer our users an opportunity to broaden their social lives and meet others in their community while doing a fun activity that doesn't require extensive planning or foresight.</p>

					<h3> Getting Started: The Basics </h3>
					<p class="text-faded">
					Sign in with Facebook and you will arrive to your main page. You can see events happening around you in the next 24 hours of your current time. For more detail, tap on the event. If you are not interested in any events, scroll down to see more. You can select the "Attend" button on any event to add yourself to that event. Tap the hamburger icon to open up a side bar displaying events you are hosting and attending. Use the "+" button to create and host your own event. You are ready to go!
					</p>
					<h3> Understand the System </h3>
                    <p class="text-faded">
					Our goal is to make this app simple, yet provide lots of functionality. The user experience is centered around a single, main screen so all the tools are easily accessible. This helps reduce the number of different screens the user must click through to get to the information or action they want. To ensure a smooth interaction we provide as much data as we can immediately to the user. If all the information can't fit on the screen, we make it only one tap away. When the user must fill in data, we have an easy form laid out with clear markings of what needs to be completed. The software was designed to be like the process of looking for events and creating events on Facebook because this is a familiar experience for most people. If you are looking for an event it will be like Facebook's "upcoming events" list. Our list will have a background picture, time, place, description, and guest/attending list. If you are creating an event, it will be in a similar order of data input starting with a title, then time, place, picture, description, and our feature of ideal number of attendees. There are no modes for our app since we give users all the functionality on one screen. Our workflow is simple. From the main screen, look for events by scrolling and adding yourself to events, create an event by completing the form provided, check events you are hosting or modify them, and check events you are attending or remove yourself from the guest list.
